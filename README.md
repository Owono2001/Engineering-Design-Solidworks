For the Engineering Design assignment, our group focused on designing various components of a bumper car using SolidWorks. Each team member was assigned specific components to model and design. My contributions included designing key components such as exhaust pipes, rubber bumpers, gas pedals, and the seat.

Exhaust Pipes: I designed the exhaust pipes by creating circular shapes, adding internal holes, and using the "Extruded Boss/Base" tool in SolidWorks. This component plays a critical role in expelling combustion gases from the bumper car.

Rubber Bumper: For the rubber bumper, I implemented a rectangular cut, used a 3-point arc tool to smooth the edges, and extruded the final design to support the vehicle's structure and ensure stability.

Gas Pedal: The gas pedal was designed with multiple extrusions and hole placements to control the amount of power supplied to the drive wheels, thus regulating the carâ€™s speed.

Seat: Lastly, I created the bumper car seat using rounding and filling techniques, ensuring it provided comfort and functionality for the driver.

Throughout the project, I improved my SolidWorks skills by actively practicing and collaborating with my teammates. The group discussions and coordination were crucial in ensuring the successful completion of the designs.
